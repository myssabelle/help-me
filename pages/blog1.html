                    <br/> In the 19 months I have stayed in my current school, I have produced, filmed and edited a couple videos for school projects. I have sweat, crawled, stood under the rain / heat, and lived through the long nights of editing. Sad to say, these two are the only ones that I am proud enough to showcase. These two were both produced in 2017, when projects was more on the artistic side of things. Before diving into things, I would sincerely apologize for any mistakes on certain details, for it has been over a year since these two have been created and things have become a little fuzzy over time.<br/><br/>
                    The first one, titled "Literature Vlog" was created due to an assignment given in the subject 21st Century Literature. We were tasked to create a video showcasing historical landmarks of Cebu. Living smack dab in the middle of the busy, thriving city of Cebu, you realize there isn't much history that is easily presented in terms of cinematography. I can truly say it made me question whether or not I was truly LIVING in this city, for I was a having a hard time deciding on where to go. I fully believe there is history everywhere, but you just have to know where to look. Cebu is filled with stories and legends of heroes and battles, tragic romance, and comedic anecdotes. But due to the lack of time, we chose to go to some well-known areas that have been embedded in history, and somewhere we believe will soon be written in history books. <strong>Fort San Pedro</strong>, a magnificent triangular structure that was originally built by the Spanish in the 1730's, is still alive and well as it nears it's third century. It has been broken down and rebuilt so many times that information has become scattered and unaccurate. It stands today as a tourist spot, and a reminder of the Spanish reign and the Philippine Revolution. Filming there was very easy but at the same time very hard. (Shoutout to my friend Ella who filmed all the bits with my face in it.) The Fort is a well known tourist spot, thus many tourists are present for most of the year. But we filmed what we could and even found time to venture a little bit into their mini museums. The next place is a nearby church.<strong>Basilica del Santo Ni√±o</strong> was the next stop. We did not stay long, we simply lit some candles and gave thanks. The church did not allow pictures beyond a certain point, and we respect their decision, thus not filming within the church. The church is indeed very beautiful and well-maintained, like the fort. It was founded in 1565, a lot older than the fort but stands as strong and as beautiful as the fort. Last stop was the <strong>Temple of Leah</strong>. This attraction is one of the new exciting features of Cebu. It was built on the foundation of love. The owner loved this woman so much that he dedicated a whole temple in her name. It is said to be inspired by Roman Architecture.
