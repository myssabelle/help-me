            This next one is quite nostalgic for me. This was created purely by sheer will and curiosity. I took this as an opportunity to explore more on my hobbies and to experiment a little on what I liked about videos. Turns out I like <strong>this</strong>s type of videos. Montage type of videos that follows a certain beat. Beautiful way to appreciate both music and film. It's very shaky, somehow yssa does not know what a tripod is. I find it kind of cute as it gives clues that makes me remember a lot of things without actually putting it on camera. Whether it may be old crushes *wink wink*, my previous go-to bag, or just objects I found particularly interesting that month. It also shows the people that was around me at that particular time of life. (It's still the same people today.) This feels like a timecapsule, something that shows me a little bit of my past, whether it may be similar to what I have now or completely different. I filmed this with two other friends - Ella and Pau - which some shots got me into trouble (ELLA'S FAULT LOL) but it's all sorted out now. I love this so much. I don't know whether it's because of nostalgia, or it's because I look kinda happier and thinner lol. Hoping everything comes full circle soon.

            These videos will be up in the videos section of my website, along with any other videos that I will upload in the future in any upcoming vlogs.

            These are a few of the pictures that I loved, whether taken by me or of my two associates. (The time where I did not know how to edit camera settings, woops) All of them can be found on my facebook page, in the album 1st sem. (It's public)
